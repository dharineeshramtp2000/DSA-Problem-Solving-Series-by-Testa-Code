### You are given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```target```. You need to return an array of two values in which the first value is an integer which represents the sum of ```nums``` and the second value is a boolean which returns ```True``` if the target is present in the array, otherwise returns ```False```. 

### Constraint:
 - You need to solve this problem in a single pass.
### Sample Input:
```
nums = [4,6,5,-2,3]
target = 6

````
### Sample Output:
```
[16, True]
```

Explanation: The sum of ```nums``` is 16 (4 + 6 + 5 + -2 + 3) and the target is present in ```nums```, therefore True.


#### If your coding language does not support Dynamic Data Types, then create a class which has two members, one representing the sum and another representing the boolean output.
